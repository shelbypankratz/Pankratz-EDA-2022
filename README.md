# Pankratz-EDA-2022

This project was designed to observe different age groups and to see how vaccination status and COVID-19 cases were correlated, if at all.

## Correlation Between COVID Cases and Vaccination Status Among Different Age Groups in the U.S.

## Abstract

-   Vaccines first became available for select populations in June 2020
-   Because of the rate vaccines were distributed, it left people skeptical about its effects and effectiveness
-   This project tests the relationship between number of COVID-19 cases and the number of people vaccinated in different age groups
-   We are using data from the CDC website to see if there's a relationship between the two variables. We are predicting that as the number of vaccinated people go up, the number of COVID-19 cases will go down.
